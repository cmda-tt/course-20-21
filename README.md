## Description

During the Tech Track you‚Äôll learn how to create interactive visualizations from external data while using libraries and advancing your web dev skills. We focus on frontend frameworks, such as React and Vue, and data visualization with D3. This enables you to make your ideas for the web into reality. Though the subject matter is technical, attention to user experience and interaction design is, as always in our programme, stressed. 

**Tech Track** is an elective track of three courses given in Information
Design (fall semester), building further on knowledge acquired in
**Internetstandaarden**, **Inleiding Programmeren**, **Frontend 1**,
**Frontend 2**, and **Backend**.

If you‚Äôd like to continue with web development after this track, pick
[**Minor Everything Web**][minor] in the spring semester!

## Assignment

To apply your learning directly, we will be working on a real life case with [De Volkskrant][krant]. You will be working with a number of datasets to do preliminary research / exploration about a topic that journalists might write an article about. During the tech-track you will regularly have to show your work to the client.
