# Interactive bar chart example (animated)

This is an enhancement on the Interactive Bar Chart example fellow teacher Laurens Aarnoudse coded up on Vizhub.

## Features

This example enhances the chart with the following things:

* Sorts descending based on highest y-axis values
* Transitions the scale based on the tick format
* Adds a tooltip for accurate y-axis reading
* Adds mouse interaction events
* Small rollup config for bundling modules
* Little bit of clean-up of 'old'code in the previous example 

## Concept

In this visualization, the data that's rendered in the view changes because of user interaction steps. A chart showing distribution or relation between to variables. The variables can be chosen through a dropdown menu resulting in a rerendering of datapoints and axis. It groups students by subject interest on x axis and gets data from different vars on y axis.
