# Some SPARQL query examples to help you out

Try putting any of the queries in this folder in [this codepen](https://codepen.io/Razpudding/pen/LKMbwZ).

Remember to change both the query and the url parameter to make it work. Or, if you have the time, edit the code so it takes the parameters from html inputs :)

Some queries have been taken/adapted from [Ivo Zandhuis' SPARQL query repo](https://github.com/ivozandhuis/SPARQL-queries)
