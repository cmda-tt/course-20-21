# Peer review exercise

## Goal
- Understand the rubric better
- Get feedback on your work
- Help a peer by giving feedback on their work

## Preparation
- [Read the rubric](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-19-20/blob/master/frontend-applications/assessment.md#rubric). Is everything clear? (data can be changed means source can change)
- Check your own readme and wiki and suplement where necessary
- Pair up in groups of two

## Review
Take about 20 minutes to do this
- Scan someone else's repo
    + is it open to issues?
    + gitignore
    + description
    + concept
    + image
    + features
    + data used
    + plagiarism and acknowledgements
- Read the wiki, can you follow the process?
- Read the code
    + Clone and install according to install notes
    + try to understand the code flow
    + Do you see any improvements?
    + Be sure to check code quality (consistency, reusability, naming conventions etc.)
- Assess assignment according to rubric (If you cant assess something, write in an issue why)
- Write your feedback in issues on their repo (separate issue for each thing)
- Positive feedback is also welcome and can be put into an issue
