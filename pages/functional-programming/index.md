## Synopsis

In functional programming (**fp**) you learn how to create visualisations from
external data, and how to clean and transform data, use svg, use d3, and
specifically use d3â€™s scales.
You additionally apply learning attained in frontend apps.

*   **Course**: Functional Programming
*   **Credit**: 3 ECTS
*   **Assessment**: Presentation

## Deliverables
* A repo with the name 'functional-programming' on Github
* A readme that describes your work to others 
* A wiki which documents your process (what did you do, what did you learn, which functional patterns did you apply, etc.)
* Code which cleans data with functional patterns. Describe the patterns used in the wiki.
