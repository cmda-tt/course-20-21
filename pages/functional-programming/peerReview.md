# Peer review exercise

## Goal
- Understand the rubric better
- Get feedback on your work
- Help a peer by giving feedback on their work
- Get a higher grade

## Preparation
- [Read the rubric](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-20-21/blob/master/pages/functional-programming/assessment.md#rubric). Is everything clear?
- Push the latest changes to your readme, code, and wiki
- Figure out in your SG who reviews who, try to stick to the same coding level

## Review
Take about 20 minutes to do this
- Go to the repo of the person you are reviewing 
    + open up an issue in a new tab
    + in one issue (the reviewee can create several issues themselves) write your review related to the points below
- Scan the repo+readme
    + gitignore?
    + no node_modules or other junk included in the uploaded files?
    + repo description?
    + concept described in readme? Research question, data to be used, sketch of datavisualization.
    + data used described properly? (what's done with invalid and empty values?)
    + link to most interesting functional pattern
    + plagiarism and acknowledgements
- Read the wiki, 
    + debrief of assignment?
    + datacleaning and transforming process described?
    + clear which functional patterns are applied in the code?
    + Do you see any improvements?
- Read the code linked in the wiki
    + try to understand the code flow
    + Is the most important code at the top?
    + Is everything split into functions? Are other principles of functional programming applied?
    + Are map/forEach used in the right way?
    + Do you see any improvements?
    + Be sure to check code quality (is it functional, consistency, reusability, naming conventions etc.)
- Assess assignment according to rubric (If you cant assess something, write in an issue why)
- Positive feedback is also welcome and can be included in the issue

## Closure
- Review the issues that were created for your own repo. Ask your peer about them if you don't understand.
- Split the issue you recieved into separate issues with an action (for instance: valid point, will fix)
- Close relevant issues before the assessment by solving them.
- If someone had trouble reviewing your work, that means a teacher will also have trouble with it, make sure your documentation is understandable.
