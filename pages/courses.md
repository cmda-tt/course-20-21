During frontend data (fd) you'll learn how to create a data visualization with d3, use data joins and DOM manipulation. The main delivarble is a static viz that suits our client's needs. You additionally learn about debugging and refactoring code as well as transforming data for use in a viz.

[Front-end Applications](frontend-applications)

In frontend apps (fa) you'll get to turn your data viz into an interactive experience AND wrap it all in an app using a front-end framework. You'll learn how to read documentation, use libraries and frameworks, and how to use build tools. Key framework concepts like components, state management and life-cycle hooks will also be covered.
