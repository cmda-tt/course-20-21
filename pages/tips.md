## Tips, tricks & cheat sheets for your home office

### Tips & tricks at home
_We have a few tips and tricks to be more productive, and feel better while coding at home_
* Imagine your desk is your office, so dress up, make sure you had breakfast, have coffee, tea or water available when you start coding.
* Plan accordingly, when you're working from home- development or experimenting can often lead to a "what now" scenario. Divide your available time, and allocate specific tasks (such as writing documentation, researching a framework, or optimizing / simplyfing code accordingly)
* Have some fresh air, open your window, take frequent walks / breaks when required. If you're starting to feel tired: We understand. Working from home can be even more exhausting than working at the office or school.
* Stay hydrated, seriously- water is amazing. Keep a bottle or glass filled next to your computer.
* Talk to people. We, the teachers and student assistants are here to help you. In addition, your class mates are working on the exact same problems as you are. Make sure to communicate, whether by text or voice if you encounter any problems, or if you feel the need to share a discovery you made. Isolation sucks, let's avoid it.
