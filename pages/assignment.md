## Client

During the Tech-Track we will be working with 'De Volkskrant'. A dutch newspaper which is seen as a _quality newspaper_. Circulation of approximately 250,000 (physical). Since 2004 they have an online website where they write interactive articles and make video reports. Within the Volkskrant is a Datalab which collects all type of data sets.

You will be working with a number of datasets from to do preliminary research / exploration about a topic that journalists might write an article about. During the tech-track you will regularly have to pitch your concept and coded visualization to the client. They will also give workshops on processing data into an article. 

[Here's an example of the kind of data stories they write.](https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/corona-wereldwijd-cijfers-over-het-coronavirus-in-alle-landen-op-een-rij~b14e8079/)
