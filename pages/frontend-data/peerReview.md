# Peer review exercise

## Goal
- Understand the rubric better
- Get feedback on your work
- Help a peer by giving feedback on their work

## Preparation
- [Read the rubric](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-20-21/blob/master/pages/frontend-data/assessment.md#rubric). Is everything clear?
- Push the latest changes to your readme, code, and wiki
- Figure out in your SG who reviews who, try to stick to the same coding level

## Review

### Repository
- Go to the repo of the person you are reviewing 
    + open up an issue in a new tab
    + in one issue (the reviewee can create several issues themselves) write your review related to the points below
- Scan someone else's repository
    + gitignore
    + link to live demo on github pages
    + description
    + concept
    + image
    + link to example used to build visualization (screenshots) concept described in readme? Research question, data to be used, sketch of datavisualization.
    + data used described properly? (what's done with invalid and empty values?)
    + plagiarism and acknowledgements

### Wiki
- can you follow the datacleaning and transforming process?
- Is there an example of a data object before and after this process?
- Is the update pattern (data flow) documented?
- Are there pages documenting what the student learned

### Live demo
- Does the visualization makes sense on it's own? (labels, axis, titles)
- Does the data shown change through interaction?

## Closure
- Review the issues that were created for your own repo. Ask your peer about them if you don't understand.
- Respond to the issues with an action (for instance: valid point, will fix)
- Close relevant issues before the assessment by solving them.
