👋 We’re a tough track on web development, frontend applications, and data visualization. We’re 👩🏽‍🎓 students, 👷🏽‍♀️ industry, and 👩🏽‍🏫 teachers combined, in one location, where everyone learns. We start October 18th and end November 27th.

We work from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m, every work day, for six weeks, in a lab setting with 40 students and 2 teachers. Every 2 weeks a new course on a particular topic.

## Students

Our students already know Bash, Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, Node, and npm. Not only that, they’re digital designers focussed on fixing problems for actual humans.

In this track we focus on frontend frameworks, such as React and Vue, and data visualistion, mostly with D3. This enables students to make their ideas for the web into reality. Though the subject matter is technical, attention to user experience and interaction design is, as always in our programme, stressed.
