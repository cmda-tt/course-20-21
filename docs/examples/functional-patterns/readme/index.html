<h1>Functional Patterns</h1>
<p>Here are some examples of functional programming patterns. Each pattern contains an <code>.md</code> file with an in-depth explanation and additional resources.</p>

<h2>Programming paradigm</h2>
<p><em>Functional programming</em> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm">programming paradigm</a>. A way to classify programming languages based on their features. JavaScript supports <strong>multiple paradigms</strong> but you'll probably use either imperative (object-oriented) or declarative (functional). Remember that functional programming are just a collection of  patterns and principles written with JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on its arguments. This might sound a bit vague but in short, you don't want your code to have any <strong>side-effects</strong>. That is if something in your code modifies some state variable value(s) outside its local environment such as a function (scope).</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">INPUT -&gt; PROCESS -&gt; OUTPUT
</code></pre>
<h2>Core principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Composing of functions. A function that operates on other functions, so limited side effects.</li>
<li>No dependence on the state of the program. Such as global variables.</li>
<li>The same input always gives the same output (purity).</li>
</ul>
