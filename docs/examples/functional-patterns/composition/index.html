<h1>Composition</h1>
<p>Make everything into a small function with a specific input and output. Then combine multiple functions in to something more complex.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Below is a good example taken from the Ali Spittel article on Sitepoint:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const sum = arr =&gt; arr.reduce((i, runningSum) =&gt; i + runningSum);
const average = (sum, count) =&gt; sum / count;
const averageArr = arr =&gt; average(sum(arr), arr.length);
</code></pre>
<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>Robert probably talked about modules. To cite <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/10">Sindre Sorhus</a> on this:</p>
<pre><code>tl;dr You make small focused modules for reusability and to make it possible to build larger more advanced things that are easier to reason about.
</code></pre>
<p><em>Just by creating modules and putting them in separate files doesn't necessarily mean that your functions are pure.</em></p>
<h2>Utilities</h2>
<p>Some developers like to make a seperation between modules and utilities. In short; utilities or helper functions can be re-used between different modules like a Matryoshka doll.</p>
<p>From the previous example you create a <code>averageArr.js</code> module that imports the <code>sum.js</code> and <code>average.js</code> utilities.</p>
<pre><code>.
├── utilities
├── helpers
└── modules
</code></pre>
