<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Assessment 1 tests your skills for <a href="./readme.md"><strong>frontend applications</strong></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: your project must be a repository on GitHub named <code>frontend-applications</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will download and archive your project when itâ€™s due.</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>Create a client-side application in JavaScript which dynamically renders data to views using either a front-end framework or system created by you.
Reflect on the merits and costs of frameworks together.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>This assessment focusses on <a href="../readme.md#goal-1">goal 1</a> (<strong>learn how to create with
libraries</strong>), <a href="../readme.md#subgoal-9">subgoal 9</a> (<strong>use libraries</strong>), <a href="../readme.md#subgoal-1">subgoal 1</a> (<strong>read docs</strong>), <a href="../readme.md#subgoal-2">subgoal 2</a> (<strong>write docs</strong>),
<a href="../readme.md#subgoal-5">subgoal 5</a> (<strong>manipulate elements</strong>), and <a href="../readme.md#subgoal-6">subgoal 6</a> (<strong>load external
data</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: each of this rubricâ€™s rows is cumulative: for example, to get a 5-6
on application, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4. In addition, each row has to be awarded with a &gt;=5.5 in order to receive a passing grade for this course.
Bonus points can be rewarded when you've helped fellow students progress. But only if you already have a passing grade.</p>
