<h1>Peer review exercise</h1>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Understand the rubric better</li>
<li>Get feedback on your work</li>
<li>Help a peer by giving feedback on their work</li>
<li>Get a higher grade</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-20-21/blob/master/pages/functional-programming/assessment.md#rubric">Read the rubric</a>. Is everything clear?</li>
<li>Push the latest changes to your readme, code, and wiki</li>
<li>Figure out in your SG who reviews who, try to stick to the same coding level</li>
</ul>
<h2>Review</h2>
<p>Take about 20 minutes to do this</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the repo of the person you are reviewing
<ul>
<li>open up an issue in a new tab</li>
<li>in one issue (the reviewee can create several issues themselves) write your review related to the points below</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scan the repo+readme
<ul>
<li>gitignore?</li>
<li>no node_modules or other junk included in the uploaded files?</li>
<li>repo description?</li>
<li>concept described in readme? Research question, data to be used, sketch of datavisualization.</li>
<li>data used described properly? (what's done with invalid and empty values?)</li>
<li>link to most interesting functional pattern</li>
<li>plagiarism and acknowledgements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read the wiki,
<ul>
<li>debrief of assignment?</li>
<li>datacleaning and transforming process described?</li>
<li>clear which functional patterns are applied in the code?</li>
<li>Do you see any improvements?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read the code linked in the wiki
<ul>
<li>try to understand the code flow</li>
<li>Is the most important code at the top?</li>
<li>Is everything split into functions? Are other principles of functional programming applied?</li>
<li>Are map/forEach used in the right way?</li>
<li>Do you see any improvements?</li>
<li>Be sure to check code quality (is it functional, consistency, reusability, naming conventions etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assess assignment according to rubric (If you cant assess something, write in an issue why)</li>
<li>Positive feedback is also welcome and can be included in the issue</li>
</ul>
<h2>Closure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review the issues that were created for your own repo. Ask your peer about them if you don't understand.</li>
<li>Split the issue you recieved into separate issues with an action (for instance: valid point, will fix)</li>
<li>Close relevant issues before the assessment by solving them.</li>
<li>If someone had trouble reviewing your work, that means a teacher will also have trouble with it, make sure your documentation is understandable.</li>
</ul>
