<h1>Peer review exercise</h1>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Understand the rubric better</li>
<li>Get feedback on your work</li>
<li>Help a peer by giving feedback on their work</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-19-20/blob/master/functional-programming/assessment.md#rubric">Read the rubric</a>. Is everything clear?</li>
<li>Push the latest changes to your readme, code, and wiki</li>
<li>Pair up in groups of two</li>
</ul>
<h2>Review</h2>
<h3>Repository</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scan someone else's repository
<ul>
<li>gitignore</li>
<li>link to live demo on github pages</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>concept</li>
<li>image</li>
<li>link to example used to build visualization (screenshots)</li>
<li>data used (what's done with invalid and empty values?)</li>
<li>plagiarism and acknowledgements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read the wiki, can you follow the datacleaning and transforming process?
<ul>
<li>Is the update pattern (data flow) documented?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Concept</h3>
<ul>
<li>Does the visualization makes sense on it's own? (labels, axis, titles)</li>
<li>What patterns do you see in this visualization. What can a user (viewer) learn?</li>
<li>Is the visualization build for a target audience? (write in issue)</li>
<li>How does the data change based on interaction (hide show svg's, data filtering?)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read the code
<ul>
<li>try to understand the code flow</li>
<li>Do you see any improvements? (is it functional, consistency, reusability, naming conventions etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assess assignment according to rubric (If you cant assess something, write in an issue why)</li>
<li>Write your feedback in issues on their repo (separate issue for each thing)</li>
<li>Positive feedback is also welcome and can be put into an issue</li>
</ul>
<h2>Closure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review the issues that were created for your own repo. Ask your peer about them if you don't understand.</li>
<li>Respond to the issues with an action (for instance: valid point, will fix)</li>
<li>Close relevant issues before the assessment by solving them.</li>
</ul>
