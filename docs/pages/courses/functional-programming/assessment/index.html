<p><strong>Note</strong>: each of this rubricâ€™s rows is cumulative: for example, to get a 5-6
on application, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4. In addition, each row has to be awarded with a &gt;=5.5 in order to receive a passing grade for this course.
Bonus points can be rewarded when you've helped fellow students progress. But only if you already have a passing grade.</p>
